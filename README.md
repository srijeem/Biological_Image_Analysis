# Biological_Image_Analysis



### Protein_Localization_Analysis

MATLAB analysis of fluorescence microscopy time-lapse images to study protein localization. Includes channel extraction, 
intensity analysis, temporal visualization, and contrast enhancement using the RapaMycin_LMB1_SnailA.tif dataset.


### Hela Gradient_Analysis
MATLAB scripts for processing multi-channel time-lapse fluorescence microscopy data of HeLa cells. 
Includes gradient-based image analysis to study cell edge dynamics over time.
